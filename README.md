## Task:
Write an application that reverses all the words of input text:

  E.g. "abcd efgh" => "dcba hgfe"

All non-letter symbols should stay on the same places:

  E.g. "a1bcd efg!h" => "d1cba hgf!e"
  
## Problem:
Writing clean code is important because it allows you to clearly communicate with the next person who works with what you've written. Being able to return to previously written code and understand what it does is key, especially in the software development world. By writing clean code, you will make yourself a better teammate, employee, and developer.

This simple project is my entry point to the world of clean code, Junit testing, getting used to Git and getting my code reviewed.

## Technologies used:
Plain Java

Junit

Git
